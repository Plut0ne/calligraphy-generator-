A python project that tries to emulate the small differences that are present in handwriting.

Ideally this would be a python program that takes as input an image of a person's handwriting and some text.
The result is another image that will contain the text written in the handwriting of the given image.

The main point is that the various letters are not just copies of those in the original image but are generated in such a way as 
to have small differences at every occurrence. In this way each letter will be different from the others exactly as happens in real handwriting.
